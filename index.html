        <p>hello,</p>
        <p>despite doing computer things for the better part of 2 decades, i have never had a computer job. i wrote php4 and js before querySelector and forEach but i never had accredited training or corporate experience so i never attempted a career wherein any of my keyboard mashing would be relevant. in 2025 that is going to change.</p>
        <p>the FAC bootcamp is the ideal opportunity to patch the blind spots in my life-long hobbyist's skillset and understand what is expected in a professional development environment. i believe i am a good candidate because i am an enthusiastic amateur, used to solving problems by himself, with a clear and concrete goal of finding employment in software development. </p>
        <p>in my free time i play CTFs, stumble through AoC in haskell and reread the rust documentation as though it will eventually make some sense to me. my code sometimes gets merged into free software projects like weechat but please don't make me show it to anyone.</p>
        <p>i like computers. here's some javascript wot i done:</p>
